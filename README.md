# RatingStars add-on for Vaadin

RatingStars is a typical rating component often
seen in web applications. By default the component
displays five stars for the user to give ratings.

The number of stars can be defined by using the
`setMaxValue(int)` method and by customizing the CSS
you can create your own star graphics.

You can also give captions for individual values by
calling one of the overloaded `setValueCaption` methods.
