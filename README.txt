RatingStars is a typical rating component often seen in web applications.
By default the component displays five stars for the user to give ratings. 
The number of stars can be defined by using the setMaxValue(int) method 
and by customizing the CSS you can create your own star graphics.

Use the provided build.xml to build the widgetset. Before running the script
you must update the build.properties file to match your environment.
