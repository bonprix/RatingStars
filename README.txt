RatingStars is a typical rating component often seen in web applications.
By default the component displays five stars for the user to give ratings. 
The number of stars can be defined by using the setMaxValue(int) method 
and by customizing the CSS you can create your own star graphics.

You can also give captions for individual values by calling one of the
overloaded setValueCaption methods.
